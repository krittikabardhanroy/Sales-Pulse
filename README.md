SALES PULSE


Problem statement:

As sales performance continues to drop, the lack of a centralized, streamlined system for data analysis is impeding leaders' ability to respond quickly and make data-driven decisions. This is leading to delays in identifying sales trends, formulating effective strategies, and implementing corrective measures, further exacerbating the decline in sales across these regions.
